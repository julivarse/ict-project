 <h1>About Zuri</h1>
 <div class="content">
   <p>My favorite artists are Adele, New kids on the block, and Amy winehouse. I also enjoy watching romantic comedies and going to the beach with my family.
  Hi! My name is Zuri, I’m 13 years old, and I absolutely love soccer. Ever since I was little, I’ve loved kicking a ball around, trying new moves, and playing games with my friends. Being on the field makes me feel alive and free.
I play as a midfielder, which is awesome because I get to help out with both defense and attack. I’m always looking for the perfect pass or trying to win the ball back. My coaches say I’m focused, hardworking, and a great teammate.
My biggest inspiration is Alexia Putellas. I think she’s amazing—super skilled and a great leader. One of my biggest dreams is to become a professional soccer player and maybe even play for the national team one day.
When I’m not playing soccer, I like reading adventure books, listening to music, and hanging out with my dog, Rocky. He’s super playful and follows me everywhere—even when I’m practicing in the backyard.
I know chasing big dreams takes a lot of hard work, but I’m ready to give it everything I’ve got. Every practice gets me one step closer. </p>
